## Getting Started

Build host and guest kernel as well as VMM in a docker container.

```sh
# On your Host
cd ./docker
./docker-build.sh
./docker-run.sh

# In the container
$ ./build.sh --package
```

This builds host and guest kernel, qemu and ovmf for your host machine.
Upon completion, install the host kernel on your machine.

### VM Image
Create an ubuntu 22.04 image in qcow2 format. See ./run.sh script.

### Artifact Evaluation
This code is still a work in progress.
We plan to apply for artifact evaluation when time permits.
